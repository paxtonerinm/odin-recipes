    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>3 medium overripe bananas</li>
        <li>⅓ cup organic granulated sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup organic brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans, vegan chocolate chips, or your favorite banana bread stir-in)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a 9-inch loaf pan and arrange a strip of parchment paper width-wise along the center, with just a bit hanging out over each side.</li>
        <li>Peel the bananas and place them into a large mixing bowl. Mash them well with a fork or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla to the bowl. Stir until well-mixed.</li>
        <li>Add the flour to the bowl, then sprinkle the baking soda, cinnamon and salt on top of the flour.</li>
        <li>Stir everything together just until mixed. Don't overmix. The batter will be thick.</li>
        <li>Fold in the walnuts.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack. Allow the loaf to cool for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the pan.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol></p>
