    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This <em>delicious</em> vegan lasagna recipe almost perfectly
        emulates the real thing, making it the perfect meal for almost any occasion.
        Two types of tofu, with the help of some nutritional yeast and spices,
        comprise the "ricotta" in the dish, allowing for the classic texture
        and cheesy taste you find in real lasagna! Thanks to <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes/vegan-baked-stuffed/spinach-lasagna/">
        Forks Over Knives</a> for providing this recipe.</p>
        <p>Taste isn't the only noteworthy aspect of this dish, it's also good
        for you! The spinach, tofu, and no-salt-added sauce provide essential
        nutrients without compromising on taste. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 (12.3-ounce) package silken tofu</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh water-packed firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy milk</li>
            <li>1−2 pounds fresh spinach, lightly steamed</li>
            <li>8 ounces no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>7 cups fat-free pasta sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy parmesan or Parma vegan parmesan</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>To make the ricotta, combine all ingredients in a food processor and process until fairly smooth. Place into a large bowl, and set aside.</li>
            <li>To make the spinach, steam at least 1 pound of fresh spinach (2 if you really like spinach) for about a minute or two, just until slightly wilted.</li>
            <li>Drain well, then either mix the spinach into the ricotta or layer the spinach over it when assembling the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread 1 cup of the pasta sauce over the bottom of the baking dish. Then cover the sauce with a layer of noodles. Next, spread half of the ricotta mixture (and half of the spinach if not mixed into the ricotta) over the noodles, and top with 2 more cups of the sauce. Add another layer of noodles, the rest of the tofu mixture (and spinach if separate), 2 cups more of the sauce, and the rest of the noodles. Spoon the remaining 2 cups of sauce over the noodles (make sure you cover all the edges), and sprinkle some parmesan over the top. Cover with parchment paper and then with foil.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 30 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol></p>
