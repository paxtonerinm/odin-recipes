        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pizza sauce boasts a <strong>bold</strong> and rich flavor but costs
        very little to make. Leftovers last for a while in the fridge and the recipe 
        makes enough for multiple pizzas.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 6oz. can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil </li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil and garlic to a sauce pot and cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, salt, basil, oregano, some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill), and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot, allow the pot to come to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, and let simmer for 15 minutes minimum, or up to 30 minutes (I often let it simmer as I prepare my pizza dough).</li>
        </ol></p>
